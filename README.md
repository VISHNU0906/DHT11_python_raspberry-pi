# DHT11_python_raspberry-pi
HI GUYS,

1.THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY USING DHT11 SENSOR VIA RASPBERRY PI 

2.YOU WILL NEED A RASPBERRY PI WITH THE RASBIAN OS,DH11 SENSOR,JUMPER WIRES AND A SMALL BREAD BOARD 

3.FIRST TAKE A BREAD BOARD AND INSERT THE DHT11 SENSOR,NOW CONNECT THE GPIO PINS AS FOLLOWS: 

4.TAKE A JUMPER WIRE,CONNECT THE GROUND PIN OF THE DHT11 TO PIN(6) OF THE RASPBERRY PI 

5.TAKE ANOTHER JUMPER WIRE,CONNECT THE DATA PIN OF THE DHT11 TO PIN (7) OF THE RASPBERRY PI 

6.AND CONNECT,THE LAST PIN OF THE DHT11 WHICH IS VCC TO PIN (2) OF THE RASPBERRY PI 

7.NOW THE CIRCUIT PART IS OVER LET'S JUMP TO PROGRAMMING PART
